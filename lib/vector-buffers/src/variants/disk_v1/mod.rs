    // the "new style".

    // Logic of this transition code:
    // - if there is not an existing directory matching the old style path, then use the new style
    //   path (regardless of whether or not the new style path exists)
    // - if there is a data directory for both the old style and new style paths, use the new style
    //   path, but we also try opening the database under the old style path to see if it still
    //   contains any data:
    //   -- if there is any data in the old style path, emit a warn log that
    //      there is still data in the old style path, which may represent older records --- if there
    //      is no data in the old style path, then delete the old style path entirely and simply move
    //      forward with the new style path
    //   -- if there is a data directory for the old style path only, move it to the "new style" path,
    //      and use the new style path
    //
    // This should provide an effective transition for users switching to 0.19.1 from 0.18.0 or
    // earlier that transparently switches directories if there is no data in the old buffer, but
    // warns them appropriately if there is.  We don't try to read the old data preferentially
